# 0click_HTB

This repository contains exploit scripts which require zero additional interaction by the attacker or victim, that's why they are  0-click exploit scripts.
I've solved these 16 HackTheBox machines with the objective to help me study for the OSWE certification.

Most of these scripts either allow you to obtain a reverse shell on the target machine or it displays a SSH private key of a user inside the box.

Disclaimer:
Personally I like to proxy every request with Burp, in order to make it easier to debug the requests being sent but in this case I decided to comment out that part of the code.
